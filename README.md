# Ex-3: Regression in Harry Potter Universe

## Overview
In this exercise, we will use regression to predict the value of vaults in a hypothetical scenario based on the number of gold and silver coins in each vault.

## Objectives
1. Train a model using given data of vaults.
2. Use the trained model to predict the value of other vaults.

## The Assignment
We are in the Harry-Potter-verse. 
We have the data about the value of several vaults in GB Pounds.
We also know how many pieces of gold there are in each vault.
Here is a list.
you don't have to copy it, a function in the tests will generate it. 

| # Gold | # Silver | Value (GBP)  |
|-------|------|---------|
| 24.0, | 2.0, | 1422.40 |
| 24.0, | 4.0, | 1469.50 |
| 16.0, | 3.0, | 1012.70 |
| 25.0, | 6.0, | 1632.20 |
| 16.0, | 1.0, |  952.20 |
| 19.0, | 2.0, | 1117.70 |
| 14.0, | 3.0, |  906.20 |
| 22.0, | 2.0, | 1307.30 |
| 25.0, | 4.0, | 1552.80 |
| 12.0, | 1.0, |  686.70 |
| 24.0, | 7.0, | 1543.40 |
| 19.0, | 1.0, | 1086.50 |
| 23.0, | 7.0, | 1495.20 |
| 19.0, | 5.0, | 1260.70 |
| 21.0, | 3.0, | 1288.10 |
| 16.0, | 6.0, | 1111.50 |
| 24.0, | 5.0, | 1523.10 |
| 19.0, | 7.0, | 1297.40 |
| 14.0, | 4.0, | 946.40  |
| 20.0, | 3.0, | 1197.10 |

We would like to guess the value of a few other vaults, given the number of gold and silver coins known to be in them.

### Part 1. Train a model 
* Using 1d or 2d data, (i.e. using just the gold pieces counter or both coin cunter), create a model and train it. 
* The tests will pass when the loss is small enough.
* You need to change some of the code in the file `regression.py` - follow what we did in class.
* You can get a tuple with the shape of a tensor using `shape`

### Part 2. Use the model to predict some unknown values
* Once you've trained the model, these tests will predict some unseen vaults.
* Thought excercise - ungraded, how would you calculate the modeled value of a gold coin, given a trained model?

## Validating and Evaluating Your Results

### Online
1. After committing and pushing your code, check the mark on the top line (near the commit ID).
2. If some tests are failing, click on the ‚ùå to open up a popup, which will show details about the errors.
3. You can click the [Details]() link to see what went wrong. Pay special attention to lines with the words "Failed" or "error".

4. Near the bottom of the [Details]() page, you can see your score. Here are examples of 0/5 and 5/5:

![score](images/score.png) ![success](images/success.png)

5. When you achieve a perfect score, you will see a green checkmark near the commit ID.

### Locally
1. You can test your code locally by installing and running `pytest` (`pip install pytest` or `conda install pytest`).
2. Run the tests using the command `pytest` in your terminal. This will show the status of each test and any errors that occurred.

Good luck!
